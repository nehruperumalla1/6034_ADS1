There are 4 different algorithms like Quick Find, Quick Union, Weighted Quick Union, Weight Quick Union with path compression.
The Weighted Quick Union Path Compression is better because the time complexity to solve the problem is very less when compared with the other algorithms.
N+Mlog*N. N is the number of objects and M is the number of operations.
